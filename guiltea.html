By revamping the site, we hoped the company’s brand shines through and can grow to be one that customers know and trust. In order to express their <strong>originality</strong> as a stand-out boba shop, we will redesign their current website to convey a modern yet friendly aesthetic through thoughtful and informative contents to cater to the boba enthusiasts of San Diego.</h4>

We learned in-depth about how the company grew from client's <strong>passion</strong> and love towards baking and cooking, so it was important to portray Guiltea’s <strong>distinctiveness</strong> by accentuating bright colors and attention-grabbing visuals. We were able to discover the main themes of Guiltea Cravings, what they serve, and how they differentiate from other boba places. Then, we proceeded to conduct a website needfinding with the client, identifying features he wants to keep or remove as we navigated through the current site. We aimed to improve on the interactive content of the site while keeping the clicks <strong>minimal</strong> so that it remains easy for the user to navigate through the site. We were then able to set priorities primarily based on clients' needs and interests.</h4>

All these customers will benefit from the friendly, welcoming vibe that the site gives off, along with the clear navigation and contents it provides.
The goal of this website is to allow users to feel the welcoming ambience of the business and its brand, as if they’re visiting store through the site. We will aim this by approaching a friendly and convenient user experience, providing them with easy-to-use functions, colorful and engaging images, and straightforward contents. After organizing description of major categories, we generated a site architecture diagram portraying the navigation bar for our prototype.

The overall personality and tone that Guiltea Cravings will express through the website will revolve around being friendly, inviting, and fun. We believe that these characteristics will help attract customers to the quaint and wholesome boba shop. We will maintain a minimal yet vibrant interface with some eye-catching graphics and imagery. The tone of the writing style expressed throughout the website will be chatty and personal in order to create an engaging method of communication with customers. Upon visiting the website, we want to ensure that the users are not overloaded with too much content. This requires a balance between informative text and meaningful visuals. The color palette of the website will consist of a blend of bright colors, and their more muted hues. The brighter colors will be used to emphasize call-to-action buttons and interactions. The muted colors can act as the foundation for the website. The imagery we incorporate into the site will consist of candid images to emphasize who the customers are and what they enjoy at Guiltea Cravings. From the competitor sites, we saw that editing imagery to follow a cohesive style guide was eye-catching. As a result, we aim to emulate this methodology in bringing attention to the meaningful images and content we add.

We leaned more towards the <strong>Eventbrite</strong> widget, since it has a secure, flexible, and large support service and our client expressed his approval for it. Another advantage of choosing the widget as our selected concept was that we can incorporate elements of the ground-up HTML/CSS website into the solution while taking advantage of a trusted service. Though creating it from ground-up would be ideal as it would come as no cost to both our client and the ticket buyers, we concluded that it would not be very feasible due to time and other constraints. After we receieved access to the code for the widget once we selected our layout, we redesigned the <strong>user interface</strong> of the client’s website to incorporate all required information with brand consistency and the widget at the heart of the page. The webpage also contains an interactive map, showing the location of the concert and the Facebook Page for the event.</h4>

                                        Now that our prototype is in its final stage, we decided to test it out with our client John and the same people we initially interviewed. We had them go through the process of <i>locating the event</i> and <i>purchasing</i> a combination of lawn, table seats, and VIP table tickets. For testing purposes, we made all the tickets free of cost. Due to the request of our client, we decided to not let our buyers select their own seating arrangements, so we were unable to show the user where they will be sitting during the actual event. Thus, we planned to create a seating chart for the venue that corresponds to the seating assignment on each ticket to remedy this problem.

Since mobile devices are a convenient way for users to show their tickets at the door, we recommended users and the client to utlilize the Eventbrite app to pull up their tickets (QR code) on the phone to scan. Besides the minor issues with the mobile aspect, the main concern that emerged from testing is with the <strong>VIP tables</strong>. Many users including our client, found it confusing that the only choices for this option were 0 <strong>OR</strong> 10 tickets. We intended to define 10 as 10 seats at the table, but one of the users mentioned that it would make more sense to count it as <strong>1 ticket for 1 table</strong>. 
                                        <br><br>Through many testing and iterations, we found out not only is the VIP table option confusing, but also that during checkout, each ticket asks for a name, email, and mailing address. Users had to tediously fill out this information 10 times under eight minutes, so we kept these concerns in mind as we further <strong>refine</strong> our prototype.

Overall, our solution appropriately completes our client’s requirements while still being feasible and affordable. Accordingly, our research consisted of personally finding and testing ticketing services and conducting user testing on selected ticketing services. This research and development paved the way for our final design, a fully functional web page with a built-in eventbrite widget.

                                        I had the honor of working with 6 other wonderful goal-driven individuals as my <strong>first design-based</strong> team project. We all carried out our responsibilities as different roles, and needless to say, it was one of the best group projects I've experienced. Working with a real-world client, John Morley, along with organization's board members with such compassionate hearts was definitely inspiring. This is where I opened my eyes to creating not only user-friendly but also <strong>all-inclusive</strong> designs, by seeing how the Rotary Club selflessly gives back to the community. As a <i>Client Liaison</i>, I learned how to effectively communicate with the client and help team members understand his needs or expectations. From holding user interviews and designing necessary materials (e.g. logo, manual) to visiting the event site, this project was an unforgettable experience that I'll forever cherish. </h4>
