By revamping the site, we hoped the company’s brand shines through and can grow to be one that customers know and trust.

We learned in-depth about how the company grew from client's <strong>passion</strong> and love towards baking and cooking, so it was important to portray Guiltea’s <strong>distinctiveness</strong> by accentuating bright colors and attention-grabbing visuals. We were able to discover the main themes of Guiltea Cravings, what they serve, and how they differentiate from other boba places. Then, we proceeded to conduct a website needfinding with the client, identifying features he wants to keep or remove as we navigated through the current site. We aimed to improve on the interactive content of the site while keeping the clicks <strong>minimal</strong> so that it remains easy for the user to navigate through the site. We were then able to set priorities primarily based on clients' needs and interests.</h4>

All these customers will benefit from the friendly, welcoming vibe that the site gives off, along with the clear navigation and contents it provides.
The goal of this website is to allow users to feel the welcoming ambience of the business and its brand, as if they’re visiting store through the site. We will aim this by approaching a friendly and convenient user experience, providing them with easy-to-use functions, colorful and engaging images, and straightforward contents. After organizing description of major categories, we generated a site architecture diagram portraying the navigation bar for our prototype.

The overall personality and tone that Guiltea Cravings will express through the website will revolve around being friendly, <strong>inviting</strong>, and fun. We worked to implement these themes into our Low-Fidelity Prototypes by aiming to portray minimal yet <strong>vibrant</strong> interface with gradients and eye-catching imagery. Upon visiting the website, we want to ensure that the users are not overloaded with too much content. This requires a balance between informative text and <strong>meaningful</strong> visuals, as noted in the functional specification explanations below. Brighter colors will be used to emphasize call-to-action buttons and interactions and muted colors can act as the foundation for the website. As a result, we aim to emulate this methodology in bringing attention to the significant images, content, and functions we add.</h4>

In this stage, I was responsible for typing up necessary descriptions and re-coding the menu page from our bootstrapped theme (e.g. gather images for menu ites, divide categories into sections, hover-over descriptions, Grubhub button). A general <strong>layout</strong> was implemented, but we had to gain feedback and adjust according to our client's needs. Finding high-quality banner pictures required more time and effort, so we deployed temporary placeholder banners for our first prototype.

                                        <br>We continued to finalize elements such as fonts and make sure that our design is consistent throughout the site. Some of the <strong>challenges</strong> we faced throughout this process revolved around really understanding the brand that the client wanted. Finding good quality images was really difficult because the images he provided were often too small. We attempted to take pictures ourselves and digged through hundreds of photos on store's Yelp page, but overall getting the right imagery was a challenge as well as making the images <strong>responsive</strong> because the sizes were all different. We revamped the whole menu page from our 1st prototyped because one of the core objective was to showcase the menu in an effective and user-friendly way. The client stated how menu was outdated and it was constantly changing. So, we displayed a fixed list of signature items and provided access to list of current items and their prices.

After various check-ins with our client throughout the quarter, we were able to attain our goals of re-designing the site to look more modern and also minimize the number of clicks it takes to get to parts of the site.

We plan to have our website<strong> published</strong> live on client's domain by end of the school year in June.

                                        <h4 class = "text-black">Professor Kirsh's series courses was the turning point of my design career, as I was able to <strong>blossom</strong> and transition myself more as a UX researcher and designer while also learning how to code! I was previously waitlisted for this class, but everything worked out in the end: a spot opened up and I was placed in a team that was trying to contact and choose my favorite boba store in San Diego as the client.
                                        Having prior experience working with small businesses in terms of marketing and branding, I was grateful to be given the opportunity to learn how to design and develop a business site and get through the process all the way up to web hosting. I'm proud of our team for collaborating productively through meetings and by creating/using the development plan to ultimately create a simple yet <strong>streamlined</strong> website that customers can easily navigate through. </h4>
