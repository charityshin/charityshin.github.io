Our team looked to <strong>Spotify</strong> as our redesigning focus. The process consisted of changing several aspects within the construction and managmenent of <strong>playlists</strong>. Spotify sifts through the metadata of playlists to compile even more playlists that are specifically geared towards users' preferences. These include songs that are genre-specific, mood-dependent, activity-reliant, or even environmentally contingent — all filtered under the unique umbrella of a user’s specific musical taste.</div>

Through initial research, we found out that many users are hindered from curating Spotify playlists with efficiency due to its lack of clarity and discoverability in its current interactive features. We aimed to resolve these issues through careful research, analysis, and prototyping.

                                        From this, we were able to  discover intriguing findings, such as the fact that interviewees often do not pay attention to the extensive list of options, and rather, preferred to see <strong>clear choices</strong> in the form of large tiles (grid) that are seen in other parts of the application. A few even mentioned that they particularly liked the <strong>curated</strong> aspect of Spotify which made them use it more than other music applications that are often not as personalized (e.g. Soundcloud, Amazon Music). Based on those interviews, we created user scenarios based on 3 aspects: playlist creation, management, and other core activities within the mobile app.

                                        Since developing user scenarios, our redesign drew on aspects that we found well-designed from other music applications that use playlists. We constructed these ideas from comparing different workflows from those scenarios within different applications, (i.e. matching the playlist workflows from Spotify to those of <strong>Apple Music</strong>, <strong>Soundcloud</strong>, and <strong>Amazon Music</strong>). Thus, we focused mainly on the flow of creating a playlist based on existing playlists.

                                        We used four criteria to decide which concept we would implement in our solution. <strong>Affordability</strong> was important given that our client is a non-profit and has limited funds to carry out a large event. <strong>Usability</strong> was another important criteria since we wanted the event-goers to be able to quickly and efficiently purchase their tickets, leading us to make the software as intuitive as possible. <strong>Social impact</strong> was another one due to the importance of spreading awareness about the Rotary Club and its service activities. <strong>Feasibility</strong> was the last criteria because of the limited time we were given and the necessity of getting the solution implemented in time for next year's event. With these four criteria in mind, we created two prototypes from existing widgets such as Eventbrite and Universe as well as our own Mock-Up wireframe.</h4>

We leaned more towards the <strong>Eventbrite</strong> widget, since it has a secure, flexible, and large support service and our client expressed his approval for it. Another advantage of choosing the widget as our selected concept was that we can incorporate elements of the ground-up HTML/CSS website into the solution while taking advantage of a trusted service. Though creating it from ground-up would be ideal as it would come as no cost to both our client and the ticket buyers, we concluded that it would not be very feasible due to time and other constraints. After we receieved access to the code for the widget once we selected our layout, we redesigned the <strong>user interface</strong> of the client’s website to incorporate all required information with brand consistency and the widget at the heart of the page. The webpage also contains an interactive map, showing the location of the concert and the Facebook Page for the event.</h4>

                                        Now that our prototype is in its final stage, we decided to test it out with our client John and the same people we initially interviewed. We had them go through the process of <i>locating the event</i> and <i>purchasing</i> a combination of lawn, table seats, and VIP table tickets. For testing purposes, we made all the tickets free of cost. Due to the request of our client, we decided to not let our buyers select their own seating arrangements, so we were unable to show the user where they will be sitting during the actual event. Thus, we planned to create a seating chart for the venue that corresponds to the seating assignment on each ticket to remedy this problem.

                                        <br>Even though there was minimal testing done on <strong>mobile</strong>, we went through the process ourselves to work on resolving issues such as difficulty scrolling through ticket options without accidentally scrolling down the website. Since mobile devices are a convenient way for users to show their tickets at the door, we recommended users and the client to utlilize the Eventbrite app to pull up their tickets (QR code) on the phone to scan. Besides the minor issues with the mobile aspect, the main concern that emerged from testing is with the <strong>VIP tables</strong>. Many users including our client, found it confusing that the only choices for this option were 0 <strong>OR</strong> 10 tickets. We intended to define 10 as 10 seats at the table, but one of the users mentioned that it would make more sense to count it as <strong>1 ticket for 1 table</strong>. 
                                        <br><br>Through many testing and iterations, we found out not only is the VIP table option confusing, but also that during checkout, each ticket asks for a name, email, and mailing address. Users had to tediously fill out this information 10 times under eight minutes, so we kept these concerns in mind as we further <strong>refine</strong> our prototype.

The three other applications we researched were Apple Music, Soundcloud, and Amazon Music. As part of this project, I also researched the various genres within these mentioned applications, as it was important to see how different applications categorize the variously-named genres (or moods and activities). For instance, Soundcloud only has one set of genres presently divided in two categories, New & Hot chart and Top 50 chart, on the Home screen. On the other hand, Spotify combines Genres and Moods together to provide different playlists within various categories, such as Country, Workout, Focus, and Christian.</h4>
