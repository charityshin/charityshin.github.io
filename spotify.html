The redesigning process consisted of changing several aspects of the application. Through our research, interviews, and observations, we discovered that Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming platforms that offers 30 million songs and has garnered over 100 million active users.
<br><br>
Moreover, this application has become strongly playlist-driven as it consists of over 2 billion playlists, thanks to its many users who create playlist after playlist. Spotify sifts through the metadata of all these playlists to compile even more playlists that are specifically geared towards its users. Playlists include songs that are genre specific, mood-dependent, activity-reliant, or even environmentally contingent — all filtered under the unique umbrella of a user’s specific musical taste.

<br><br>
In the beginning of our project, I acted as the User Researcher responsible for conducting interviews and obtaining observations from users who have used various mobile music applications. The three other applications we researched were Apple Music, Soundcloud, and Amazon Music. As part of this project, I also researched the various genres within these mentioned applications, as it was important to see how different applications categorize the variously-named genres (or moods and activities). For instance, Soundcloud only has one set of genres presently divided in two categories, New & Hot chart and Top 50 chart, on the Home screen. On the other hand, Spotify combines Genres and Moods together to provide different playlists within various categories, such as Country, Workout, Focus, and Christian.
<br><br>
I also assisted in coming up with different ideas for our prototypes, sketching and discussing as a group to discover new ideas upon ideas. Because there is no such thing as a perfect prototype, we spent plentiful amount of time deciding and shifting to new improved concepts. By implementing these prototypes and ideas on Sketch and Invision, we were able to produce our final redesigned prototype.</h3>

Individually, we conducted interviews to three users each. Initially, they were asked their preferred music applications. Below are some of the questions we asked our users; some questions and tasks were carried out spontaneously throughout the interviewing process.
<br><br>
1. How long have you been using this music app?
2. Do you use any other music apps other than this one? Which one and why ?
3. Is your app updated to the latest version?
4. When is the last time you made a playlist?
5. What kind of playlists do you have?
6. How often do you manage the playlists, such as but not limited to, adding songs or removing songs?
7. Why did you choose your preferred application? What do you like about this particular service. If they use other applications as well, what were some expectations and familiarities?
8. Do you have any suggestions or improvements you recommend?
9. What’s a feature that’s missing in your current music app that you wish existed in regards to making/managing playlists?
10. Do you hear any new music app from friend/ or anywhere?<br><br>
From this, we were able to make better decisions for user experience with more ease and efficiency. We discovered intriguing findings, such as the fact that interviewees often do not pay attention to the extensive list of options, and rather, preferred to see clear choices in the form of large tiles (grid) that are seen in other parts of the application. A few even mentioned that they particularly liked the curated aspect of Spotify which made them use it more than other music applications that are not as personalized.As a result, we wanted to improve the visibility and discoverability of this option for improved efficiency of use with more customization capability for personalized playlists.

                                        <h3 class = "text-black">In the beginning, the manager and I considered to have the certificate to be a longer length, around the size of dollar bills. Even though most gift certificates are like that, we came to realization that having it a smaller size (size of average business cards) will be easier and more convenient for people to put inside the card slots of their wallets, rather than having a bill-sized card-stock paper. So, I started to design in a standard business card dimension, 3.5 x 2, and gained insight from the stamp card design. You can now see in these two prototypes that the color is changed to a brighter orange, which can be both a marketing and a user-centered design approach.</h3>

From there, I played around with fonts and placings of texts and borders, and from there, the gift certificate started to look more legitimate.</h5>

The orange background still gave the feeling of a business card rather than a gift certificate, so a new background was added in. This matches with what the restaurant serves, and the color theme is still shown to be consistent with the orange border, logo, and font. There were many tweaks and edits made throughout the process, but the outcome made it all worthwhile. The design was carefully reviewed by the manager and owner, who approved of this final design. The final step was to make the card orders, and in the end, the clients received actual physical cards of the design. </h3>
