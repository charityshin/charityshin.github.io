Our team looked to <strong>Spotify</strong> as our redesigning focus. The process consisted of changing several aspects within the construction and managmenent of <strong>playlists</strong>. Spotify sifts through the metadata of playlists to compile even more playlists that are specifically geared towards users' preferences. These include songs that are genre-specific, mood-dependent, activity-reliant, or even environmentally contingent — all filtered under the unique umbrella of a user’s specific musical taste.</div>

Through initial research, we found out that many users are hindered from curating Spotify playlists with efficiency due to its lack of clarity and discoverability in its current interactive features. We aimed to resolve these issues through careful research, analysis, and prototyping.

                                        From this, we were able to  discover intriguing findings, such as the fact that interviewees often do not pay attention to the extensive list of options, and rather, preferred to see <strong>clear choices</strong> in the form of large tiles (grid) that are seen in other parts of the application. A few even mentioned that they particularly liked the <strong>curated</strong> aspect of Spotify which made them use it more than other music applications that are often not as personalized (e.g. Soundcloud, Amazon Music). Based on those interviews, we created user scenarios based on 3 aspects: playlist creation, management, and other core activities within the mobile app.

                                        Since developing user scenarios, our redesign drew on aspects that we found well-designed from other music applications that use playlists. We constructed these ideas from comparing different workflows from those scenarios within different applications, (i.e. matching the playlist workflows from Spotify to those of <strong>Apple Music</strong>, <strong>Soundcloud</strong>, and <strong>Amazon Music</strong>). Thus, we focused mainly on the flow of creating a playlist based on existing playlists.

With a clearer understanding of how users can discover and navigate through different music streaming services, we found out that Spotify lacks the ability to <strong>combine mixes</strong> that were curated. Our aim to improve on personalization directed most of our new features towards manipulating playlists that were curated or could be curated to each user. As of the tedious deleting process, we justified that <strong>swiping left</strong> and presenting a <strong>confirmation pop-up</strong> will be more sufficient and convenient for users.</h4>

                                        The process of sketching and wireframing was essential as we went through many phases of redeveloping our ideas and learning from the obstacles we faced. Since our prototype focused on building based on users' preferences, we wanted to make sure to emphasize user control and freedom by implementing <strong>undo</strong>, <strong>cancel</strong>, and/or <strong>back</strong> buttons on every page throughout the process of curating a playlist. Our first sketch in the figure below overlooked these user control factors, but we soon realized that users should always be able to fix their mistakes or change their minds, especially when it comes to creating a playlist based on users' interests and needs.</h4>

The key point of this feature is that users are able to easily and <strong>efficiently filter</strong> the songs inside a playlist to search for specific tracks that a user would want to add to their new mix. Once songs are selected, the application will generate a mix with these songs as well as songs that are similar to the selections - resulting in an <strong>automatically curated</strong> mix. This is because the generated mix is specifically based on songs that the user selects. The available filter preferences in the redesign include Title, Artist, Genre, Recently Added, and Most Played.
As a result, users can easily access information on tracks such as the Artist and Genre without shifting through countless pages. Users are able to filter and sort by that information as a way to expedite their process to curate their <strong>desired playlist</strong>.</h4>

This was due to the fact that interviewees often did not pay attention to the extensive list of options, as one individual stated, <i>"The tiles are cohesive with some of the other parts of the application where people can view genres, which is really nice for aesthetics and clarity." </i><br><br>An example of a <strong>difficult</strong> layout <strong>decision</strong> was the placement of the "Delete" button when deleting multiple songs. We drew it out in both the top right corner (this touches on the familiarity of users with "Finish" buttons on the top right of most applications) and the bottom middle which may be more efficient as users will be scrolling down the playlist to delete their multiple songs. Based on the convenience factor, we decided to place the button on the top right as it is always accessible (as part of the header, it is a static bar that remains when the user scrolls downwards) whereas the bottom middle location would move based on where the user is located along the playlist.<br><br>
