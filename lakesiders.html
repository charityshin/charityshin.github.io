                                        <h4 class = "text-black">Concert at the Lakes is such a renowned event amongst local residents in Santee City that tickets are sold out every year, so having a good ticketing system was essential. The previous event site redirected users to TicketRiver, where they can purchase a ticket for either a seat at a reserved table or an unreserved seating in an open lawn area. To add on, if users wanted to purchase a whole Table (for a group of people), they would have to go back to the original site and scroll down to fill out a different form. Thus, managers of Concert at the Lakes needed a better ticketing system because of current complications with seating arrangements and group ticket distributions. Our goal was to provide better <strong>user experience</strong> for ticket-buyers and better <strong>management system</strong> for site managers from Rotary Club.</h4>

                                        We used four criteria to decide which concept we would implement in our solution. <strong>Affordability</strong> was important given that our client is a non-profit and has limited funds to carry out a large event. <strong>Usability</strong> was another important criteria since we wanted the event-goers to be able to quickly and efficiently purchase their tickets, leading us to make the software as intuitive as possible. <strong>Social impact</strong> was another one due to the importance of spreading awareness about the Rotary Club and its service activities. <strong>Feasibility</strong> was the last criteria because of the limited time we were given and the necessity of getting the solution implemented in time for next year's event. With these four criteria in mind, we created two prototypes from existing widgets such as Eventbrite and Universe as well as our own Mock-Up wireframe.</h4>

We leaned more towards the <strong>Eventbrite</strong> widget, since it has a secure, flexible, and large support service and our client expressed his approval for it. Another advantage of choosing the widget as our selected concept was that we can incorporate elements of the ground-up HTML/CSS website into the solution while taking advantage of a trusted service. Though creating it from ground-up would be ideal as it would come as no cost to both our client and the ticket buyers, we concluded that it would not be very feasible due to time and other constraints. After we receieved access to the code for the widget once we selected our layout, we redesigned the <strong>user interface</strong> of the client’s website to incorporate all required information with brand consistency and the widget at the heart of the page. The webpage also contains an interactive map, showing the location of the concert and the Facebook Page for the event.</h4>

                                        Now that our prototype is in its final stage, we decided to test it out with our client John and the same people we initially interviewed. We had them go through the process of <i>locating the event</i> and <i>purchasing</i> a combination of lawn, table seats, and VIP table tickets. For testing purposes, we made all the tickets free of cost. Due to the request of our client, we decided to not let our buyers select their own seating arrangements, so we were unable to show the user where they will be sitting during the actual event. Thus, we planned to create a seating chart for the venue that corresponds to the seating assignment on each ticket to remedy this problem.

                                        <br>Even though there was minimal testing done on <strong>mobile</strong>, we went through the process ourselves to work on resolving issues such as difficulty scrolling through ticket options without accidentally scrolling down the website. Since mobile devices are a convenient way for users to show their tickets at the door, we recommended users and the client to utlilize the Eventbrite app to pull up their tickets (QR code) on the phone to scan. Besides the minor issues with the mobile aspect, the main concern that emerged from testing is with the <strong>VIP tables</strong>. Many users including our client, found it confusing that the only choices for this option were 0 <strong>OR</strong> 10 tickets. We intended to define 10 as 10 seats at the table, but one of the users mentioned that it would make more sense to count it as <strong>1 ticket for 1 table</strong>. 
                                        <br><br>Through many testing and iterations, we found out not only is the VIP table option confusing, but also that during checkout, each ticket asks for a name, email, and mailing address. Users had to tediously fill out this information 10 times under eight minutes, so we kept these concerns in mind as we further <strong>refine</strong> our prototype.

Overall, our solution appropriately completes our client’s requirements while still being feasible and affordable. Accordingly, our research consisted of personally finding and testing ticketing services and conducting user testing on selected ticketing services. This research and development paved the way for our final design, a fully functional web page with a built-in eventbrite widget.

We all carried out our responsibilities as different roles, and needless to say, it was one of the best group projects I've experienced. Working with a real-world client, John Morley, along with organization's board members with such compassionate hearts was definitely inspiring. This is where I opened my eyes to creating not only user-friendly but also <strong>all-inclusive</strong> designs, by seeing how the Rotary Club selflessly gives back to the community. As a <i>Client Liaison</i>, I learned how to effectively communicate with the client and help team members understand his needs or expectations. From holding user interviews and designing necessary materials (e.g. logo, manual) to visiting the event site, this project was an unforgettable experience that I'll forever cherish. </h4>
